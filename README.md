# SearchFeature
Interactive POST-based search box using C# and JSON.

## About
SearchFeature uses a form to search for data stored in a JSON array by key phrase, and allows the developer to format that data as needed and send it to users.

THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE WEBSITE - This web app repo contains:
 - the .aspx for the search form, 
 - the .aspx.cs to power it, and hold the JSON used,
 - Newtonsoft.Json NuGet package used to read the JSON,
 - Bootstrap (v3.3.7) and jQuery(v3.1.1) to make the UI look nice,
 - a picture of the app working.
 
 SearchFeature is designed predominantly as a development tool to make scouring through data stored in JSON on .NET sites easier.
